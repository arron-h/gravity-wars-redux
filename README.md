Gravity Wars Redux
==================

A remake of the classic space warfare game 'Gravity Wars'.

Initially targeted at iPhone 3GS but also working well on the original BlackBerry Playbook (QNX port). This code is quite old now
and is circa 2011, despite the commits from 2013 (migrated from SVN to Git).

An Android port is mostly complete but lacked TRCs such as saving state as this was not scoped on initial implementation for iOS.
